# Inspire

Inspiration can be difficult to achieve. Keep track of your many important tasks and the weather with the suttle help of a random daily quote and beatiful scenery.   


### Note: uses two Chrome only features (does not break app)

This website uses `summary::-webkit-detail-marker` used by Chrome (the drop down arrow on a `<summary>` element). This allows the cog I've placed next to the word _"Settings"_ to be placed in line with the following word and it also allows it to rotate when opening or closing the `<details>` element.

This website also uses an **HTML Import** this is only supported by Chrome as it is a feature that was abandoned in the spec. I used this HTML import to import a _Web Component_, specifically a slider, however, I do plan to migrate this away from an HTML import into a javascript module.
